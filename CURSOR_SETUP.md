# ðŸŽ² Savage Pathfinder MCP Integration with Cursor

This guide will help you integrate the Savage Pathfinder MCP server with Cursor so you can interact with the tabletop gaming system directly from the AI chat.

## ðŸ”’ **SECURITY NOTICE**

**The MCP server now requires authentication!** You must obtain an API key and configure authentication before using the server.

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup

### Step 1: Get API Access

Contact the server administrator to obtain:

- **API Key**: For authenticating MCP clients
- **JWT Secret**: For token generation (if running locally)

### Step 2: Configure Cursor MCP Settings

1. Open Cursor
2. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Features** â†’ **MCP**
3. Add the following configuration to your MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "savage-pathfinder": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/robertgilks/Source/spf-mcp/mcp-proxy.js"],
      "env": {
        "SPF_SERVER_URL": "https://spf-mcp.rob-gilks.workers.dev",
        "API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
        "JWT_TOKEN": "optional-pre-generated-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Restart Cursor

After adding the configuration, restart Cursor to load the MCP server.

### Step 4: Test the Integration

Once Cursor restarts, you should be able to use the Savage Pathfinder tools directly in chat. Try asking:

- "Create a new game session called 'Goblin Ambush'"
- "Roll 2d6+3 for damage"
